# [120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

## 题目
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [`2`],
    [`3`,4],
   [6,`5`,7],
  [4,`1`,8,3]
]
```

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

**Note:**
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
